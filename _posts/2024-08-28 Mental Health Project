The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis of a 2022 Heart Disease dataset and see what insights can be generated by visualizing the data with Power BI.
The dataset was found on Kaggle's website at [Heart Disease Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease). It includes 40 fields and 246,022 records. I utilized the 2022 dataset that has the rows with missing data removed.

The columns included are: 
- **Timestamp**: Time the survey was submitted
